Road to IMMORTAL Python
To reach Ascendant rank by building a workflow automation tool's backend, focus on these key areas. Mastering them will pave your path to Immortal.

Core Engine (Focus: Asynchronous Processing)

Workflows involve waiting for external services. Use Python's built-in asyncio library to handle these delays efficiently without blocking the entire application. This is the heart of the engine.

Nodes (Focus: Plugin Architecture)

The tool's power comes from its nodes (e.g., "Read Sheet," "Send Message"). Create a dynamic plugin system using the built-in importlib to discover and load new nodes on the fly.

Web Layer (APIs & Webhooks)

To trigger workflows and manage them externally, build a web interface. FastAPI is ideal due to its native asyncio support and built-in data validation, perfect for defining node inputs/outputs.

Connectors (Service Interaction)

Nodes need to communicate with third-party APIs. Use httpx, a modern HTTP client that supports asynchronous requests, to integrate seamlessly with your asyncio core.

Scheduling (Timed Triggers)

For workflows that run on a schedule, integrate APScheduler, a powerful library for managing timed jobs within your application.

State Management (Focus: Database & Credentials)

Store workflow definitions, execution logs, and user credentials securely. Use SQLModel or SQLAlchemy for database interaction and cryptography to encrypt sensitive API keys.

The Path Forward:

Successfully building and understanding this system is your trial for Ascendant. True mastery and the subsequent leap to Immortal will come from evolving this "AutomateOS" into a robust, real-world application.
